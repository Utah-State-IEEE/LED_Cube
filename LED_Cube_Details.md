# Project Details: USU IEEE LED Cube

**Note:** This guide contains the full details on the build for the USU IEEE LED Cube.  If you want a faster read so you can quickly start programming animations, see the **README.md** file in this repository.

## Introduction and Purpose

The USU IEEE LED cube was designed and built to provide real-world design and prototyping experience for the students of USU.  As students designed and built the project, it provided them opportunities to see real-world applications for the concepts they learned in class.  By continuing to program and improve the LED cube, it is our hope that many more students will continue learning and applying technical knowledge. In this way, the IEEE branch funds used to construct the cube will continue empowering and educating students for years to come.

This document provides full details on the construction of the cube for others to learn about and make improvements or repairs.  This document should be updated as necessary, but should never be completely deleted.  Without this document, the LED cube will quickly fall into neglect and disrepair and the funds and time devoted to its construction will be wasted.
